# Example for Arduino usage
## Prerequisites

To build the code for Arduino, we use this [library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library) from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/). A tutorial on how to add the library to your Arduino IDE can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries).

## Usage

Simply follow the connection diagram below and you can verify the Driver Board!

| Motor Servo Driver | Arduino |
| --- | ----------- |
| SDA | A4 |
| SCL | A5 |
| GND | GND |
| 5V | 5V |
| VM | 5V |
